# TinyTown

This project represents the beginning of my exploration into creating 2D games for both desktop and mobile using the Starling actionscript library.

The present state of the this project is a start screen and a horizontal parallax scrolling cityscape with animated sprites and sprites responding to mouse or touch movement.

UPDATE:
Soon after I started this project, Flex/Flash seemed to really start to crash and burn and I started to focus back on Javascript. 

I have decided to use the assets I created for the Starling prototype to create similar demos using Javascript frameworks such as Phaser and pixi.js and they will begin life under the 'TinyTown' project tree as my goal is to take the new JavaScript/HTML5 prototypes to the same point as StarlingProject.
